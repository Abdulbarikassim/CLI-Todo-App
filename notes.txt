1) Setting up the projects: 
  * Setting up the python virtual environment. 
    - Installing the needed dependencies for the project: 
       - typer: To create the CLI application.  
       - colorama: Ensures that color works efficiently. 
       - shellingham. 
       - pytest: Testing the application.
  * Define the project Layout.  
    - This Step is to frame the packages, modules and the files needed for the 
      application. 

    Here is description of the packages content: 
      - __init__.py : Enables abtodo/ to be a python package. 
      - __main__.py: Provides an entry-point script to run the app from packages
                      using the python -m abtodo command. 
      - cli.py: Provides the typer command-line interface for the application.
      - config.py: contains the code to handle the configuration of the app. 
      - database.py: contains code to handle the database of the app. 
      - abtodo.py : Provides code to connect the CLI with the todo database.
